# MetalikaPI

Metalika is a sample C# application used for management of objects such as delivery notes, issue notes, work orders etc. that are commonly used in product-oriented businesses (micro version of ERP-like system). GUI is written in Windows Forms, while all information is stored in Microsoft SQL Database and transferred back and forth with the assistance of Entity Framework. Additionally, custom .dll (that can be found under EncryptString) was built in order to provide simple one-way encryption for sensitive data.
